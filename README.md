To run you will need Python 2.7 and PySide with at least version 1.06.
You will also need some codecs to make the videos play propertly (sorry vlc fans!)

Ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras ubuntu-restricted-addons

Windows:
	Download and install the basic K-Lite Codec Pack


Please note that in it's current version, this is not intended for use at all, it is only a few hours of work on it old and will be changing vastly!
